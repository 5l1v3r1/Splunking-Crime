Splunking-Crime

We have created this app as part of our presentation in Splunk .conf 2018 in Orlando, Florida on 3rd October 2018, 2 PM local time.

As part of this app, we have added the open source data as lookups, and then used them to develop dashboards for creating predictive models.

There are 3 apps added to git:
ML Toolkit App:         Contains all the algorithms that we use for predicting.
Python Computing App:   Contains supporting scripts used for the ML Toolkit app to work properly.
Predicting Crime App:   Contains all the dashboards and data lookups that we have used.

We have updated few permissions and sharing of the macros used in the ML Toolkit app, so to allow the dashboards to work properly do copy all these 3 apps into your /etc/apps Directory of the Splunk Installation.
